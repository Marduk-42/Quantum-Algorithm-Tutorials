# Quantum Algorithm & Tutorials
This is a collection of Quantum Algorithms, written in **Open** **Q**uantum **As**se**m**bly Language (**OpenQASM**) and the Python **Qiskit** library.

In every repository you will find:
* A file named Example_qiskit.py, which contains the Qiskit version
* A file named Example.qasm, which contains the QASM version
* A file named Example_qasm.py, which contains the Python wrapper for Example.qasm

In some repositories there is also:
* A file named Exampe_qasm.jl, which contains a Julia wrapper for Example.qasm
* A file named Example.ipynb, which contains an IPython Notebook explaining the Example_qiskit.py
